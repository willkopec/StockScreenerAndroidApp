# Stock Screener: Android Application


## About the project:

This is a stock screening app that allows you to scan market indices (Dow Jones, S&P500 and NASDAQ) to find stocks that fit a specific trading strategies criteria. In this app, there are only 2 trading strategy criterias (Golden and Death cross Moving average strategies). 
More info on these strategies here [1]: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/121114/what-difference-between-golden-cross-and-death-cross-pattern.asp#:~:text=A%20golden%20cross%20suggests%20a,accompanied%20by%20high%20trading%20volume
After scanning an index, the stocks that meet the required criteria will pop up in a list view and include links to the charts (Via Yahoo Finance).
This project uses Java to create the User Interface via Android Studio and import all of the libraries needed to run the project. One of the libraries used in this project is called Chaquopy and allows for Python code to be run in Android Studio. The python code used in this project is the main code used to scan through the different market indices and check for stocks that meet the required criteria for the trading strategy.
